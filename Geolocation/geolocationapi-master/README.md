# IP Geolocation API

IP Geolocation API is a free service for geocoding requests.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/madisvain/geolocationapi)

Request geocoding is done via [CloudFlare IP Geolocation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-Cloudflare-IP-Geolocation-do-) to which additional information about the geolocated country is provided.


## Stack
